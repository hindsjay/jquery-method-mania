jQuery Method Mania!

jQuery Method Mania is a quiz game I built from scratch while I was in the Juno College of Technology JavaScript class (Dec 2019).  Project was built to demonstrate use and knowledge of JavaScript and jQuery.

Quiz tests your knowledge of jQuery method names.  If you reach 5 points without getting 3 wrong answers then you win the game.  Once you get 3 wrong answers the game ends.

JavaScript file primarily uses jQuery.  There are quite a bit of code comments in the JavaScript file and this was included for grading purposes (wanted to make sure the person reviewing the project understood thought process for code).
